# Overview

Welcome to the [AG Grid](https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid) Figma Design System, created to help Product Designers prototype and customise AG Grid applications with ease.

This directory contains the following files:

- `AG-Grid-XX-XX-XX.fig` - The Figma Design System File
- `ag-grid-figma-variables-to-css` - A node.js utility to convert Figma Local Variables to CSS
- `figma-file-archive` - An archive of previous versions

# Features

The current version of the AG Grid Figma Design System supports:

- Alpine & Alpine Dark Themes (Additional themes to be added in future releases)
- All **core** Grid components, which are a mirror image of the components in the AG Grid library (Additional components to be added in future releases)
- Conversion of Figma Local Variables to CSS with the `ag-grid-figma-variables-to-css` package

# Getting Started

To start simply download the `AG-Grid-XX-XX-XX.fig` file and open it in Figma. You'll find a getting started guide, documentation, and a tutorial video all within the design system file. For more information visit our design system [documentation](https://ag-grid.com/javascript-data-grid/ag-grid-design-system/) or check out our [YouTube Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsZlhayVgqNzE9G1yLLHQCRYSgDvx7Zo1).

*For help importing files into Figma see this [Figma help article](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041003114-Import-files-into-Figma).*

# Local Variables to CSS

If you are using the Local Variables feature in Figma, you may also want to experiment with creating and exporting a custom AG Grid theme using Figma variables. Once you've exported your custom AG Grid theme from Figma you can use the included Node.js project `ag-grid-figma-variables-to-css/` to create a custom theme to try out with AG Grid in browser. Full instructions are available [here](https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid-figma-design-system/blob/main/ag-grid-figma-variables-to-css/README.md).
