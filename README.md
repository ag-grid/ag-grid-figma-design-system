## Overview

Welcome to the [AG Grid](https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid) Figma Design System, created to help Product Designers prototype and customise AG Grid applications with ease.

This directory contains the following:

- `ag-grid-figma-variables-to-css/` - A sample node.js project to convert Figma Local Variables to CSS
- `figma-file-archive/` - An archive of previous versions
- `token-studio-archive/` - An archive of Token studios json

<br />

## Features

The AG Grid Figma Design System supports:

- Quartz, Alpine, & Material themes in light mode & darkmode
- All **core** Grid components, which are a mirror image of the components in the AG Grid library
- Conversion of Figma Local Variables to CSS with the `ag-grid-figma-variables-to-css` sample project

<br />

## Getting Started

To start working with the AG Grid Figma design system visit our [Figma community page](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1360600846643230092) and click "Open in Figma". The AG Grid design system will open directly in Figma and you're ready to start designing for AG Grid applications.

We supply the AG Grid design system as a [Figma community file](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1360600846643230092). You will use the file by duplicating it to your Figma workspace. Whilst we regularly update the AG Grid design system, your duplicated files will not receive any updates automatically.

For more information about how Figma community files function, please review the [Figma help pages on community files](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038510873-Duplicate-Community-files).

## Local Variables to CSS

If you are using the Local Variables feature in Figma, you may also want to experiment with exporting a custom AG Grid theme extension. You can export your Figma Local Variables as a `.json` file then use the [included Node.js project](/ag-grid-figma-variables-to-css/) `ag-grid-figma-variables-to-css/` to create a custom theme extension. 

Custom theme extensions can be used with our default `Quartz` theme to completely change the look of AG Grid in the browser to match your Figma designs.
