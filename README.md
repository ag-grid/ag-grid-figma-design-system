# AG Grid Design System 

Welcome to the AG Grid Figma design system. We're excited for you to begin designing with AG Grid. To start simply open the `AG-Grid-30-1-0.fig` file in Figma. 

You'll find a getting started guide, documentation, and a tutorial video all within the design system file. For more information on importing files into Figma see this [Figma help article](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041003114-Import-files-into-Figma).

You may also want to experiment with creating and exporting a custom AG Grid theme using Figma variables. Once you've exported your custom AG Grid theme from Figma you can use the included Node.js project `ag-grid-figma-variables-to-css/` to create a custom theme to try out with AG Grid in browser.

For more information visit our [design system documentation page](https://ag-grid.com/javascript-data-grid/ag-grid-design-system/).
