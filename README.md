## Overview

Welcome to the [AG Grid](https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid) Figma Design System, created to help Product Designers prototype and customise AG Grid applications with ease.

This directory contains the following files:

- `AG-Grid-XX-XX-XX.fig` - The Figma Design System File
- `AG-Grid-31-2-0-Token-Studio.json` - Design tokens for Token studio users
- `ag-grid-figma-variables-to-css` - A sample node.js project to convert Figma Local Variables to CSS
- `figma-file-archive` - An archive of previous versions

<br />

## Features

The current version of the AG Grid Figma Design System supports:

- Quartz, Alpine, & Material themes in light mode & darkmode
- All **core** Grid components, which are a mirror image of the components in the AG Grid library
- Conversion of Figma Local Variables to CSS with the `ag-grid-figma-variables-to-css` sample project

<br />

## Getting Started

To start simply download the `AG-Grid-XX-XX-XX.fig` file and open it in Figma. You'll find a getting started guide, documentation, and a tutorial video all within the design system file. For more information visit our [design system documentation](https://ag-grid.com/javascript-data-grid/ag-grid-design-system/) or check out our [YouTube Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsZlhayVgqNzE9G1yLLHQCRYSgDvx7Zo1).

*For help importing files into Figma see this [Figma help article](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041003114-Import-files-into-Figma).*

## Local Variables to CSS

If you are using the Local Variables feature in Figma, you may also want to experiment with exporting a custom AG Grid theme extension. You can export your Figma Local Variables as a `.json` file then use the [included Node.js project](/ag-grid-figma-variables-to-css/) `ag-grid-figma-variables-to-css/` to create a custom theme extension. 

Custom theme extensions can be used with our default `Quartz` theme to completely change the look of AG Grid in the browser to match your Figma designs.

<br />

## Token Studio
If you are a [Token Studio](https://tokens.studio/) user we have also supplied all our tokens in the `AG-Grid-XX-XX-XX-Token-Studio.json` file.
