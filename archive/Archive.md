Archived resources for the AG Grid Figma Design System. 

- **figma-file-archive**: Archived `.fig` files. Dating to when the design system was not available through our [Figma community file](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1360600846643230092/ag-grid-design-system).
- **token-studio-archive**: Archived Tokens Studio JSON. We no longer support Tokens Studio directly.
- **ag-grid-figma-variables-to-css**: An example Javascript project using Style Dictionary to transform Figma local variables json output into AG Grid Legacy CSS themes. Superseded by our new local variables to Javascript theming API example.
